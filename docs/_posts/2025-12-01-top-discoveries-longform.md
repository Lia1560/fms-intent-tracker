This week’s FMS and freelance-economy signals clustered around a quieter mix. We saw a mix of feature rollouts, strategic moves, and policy updates shaping how enterprises source, onboard, and manage freelancers at scale.

Stepping back, these updates reinforce 2025 themes we’re tracking: AI-assisted workflows, tighter compliance (IR35/IRS/EU), deeper integrations, and the rise of niche platforms serving specific talent communities.

In short, momentum continues to build across the FMS stack as vendors and buyers align on automation, compliance, and integrated workflows.
